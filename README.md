# gpxpy-split-tracks

## Why?
I couldn't find a product on the web that did exactly what I needed. 
I needed to take a single GPX file, with multiple tracks embeded, and split that out into individual `.gpx` files per track to be uploaded to my bike computer (Wahoo Element Bolt).
The bike computer could not figure out how to do this, and the online GPS tools like [RideWithGPS.com](https://ridewithgps.com) and [mymaps.google.com](https://mymaps.google.com), could not either.
